<h2>History</h2>

after banging my head on git, and being kicked by several to get over it, I decide that the best solution was to update the Git plugin on my little journey of enlightenment.
<p>

so after reading the early chapters of {{{ProGit}}} the following came to be. 
<p>

<h3>assumptions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I have assumed that setting up your git repro as such has been done. or forking in {{{GitHub}}} -> https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo</li>
  <li>local - git repro that is local to your editor, ie. same machine!</li>
  <li>origin
     <ul>
       <li>repro on external server</li>
       <li>repro in your {{{GitHub}}}</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
  <li>upstream: the repro your origin is forked from</li>
  <li>File assume current in editor.</li>
  <li>Directory within project</li>
  <li>Project -> project_dir</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

most of the output is displayed in a dialogue, but sometimes I use the status bar
<p>

<b>Tools -&gt;Git</b> ( only visible if current file is in a .git repository )

<h3>local</h3>

<pre>
* Staging
 * Stage File
 * Stage All
 * Unstage File ( reset HEAD file )
 * Stage Patch ( git add -p file )
* Commit

 * Commit Patch ( git commit -p file )
* Checkout
 * Checkout File
* Status

</pre>

 * Push to Origin
 * Fetch from Origin
 * Pull from Origin
</pre>

<h3>Upstream</h3>

<pre>

 * Show Upstream Info.
 * Fetch Upstream
 * Merge Upstream Master
</pre>

<h3>Branching</h3>

<pre>

 * Fetch All Branches from Origin
</pre>


<h3>GitHub</h3>

<pre>
* GitHub Pull Request
 * see "GitHUb Access" below, with out it, it won't work.
</pre>

<b>NB.</b> Context menu -> Commit All

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

<h3>Scenario 1</h3>

So you have just forked a {{{GitHub}}} repo and cloned to your local machine, made a change to a file.

<pre>
* local Stage File
* local Commit File
* Push to Origin
* {{{GitHub}}} Pull Request
</pre>

four clicks that's all

<h3>Scenario 2</h3>

Your {{{GitHub}}} fork is out of sync with the master origin.

<pre>
* Fetch Upstream
* Merge Upstream Master
* Push to Origin
</pre>

Tip use the Show * Info before and after to check if you want to.

<h2>GitHUb Access</h2>

To be able to use the github pull request, we will need a //username// and //token// being stored in environment variables (in .bash_profile or wherever) external to {{{Padre-Plugin-Git}}}

<pre>
* my $user  = $ENV{GITHUB_USER};
 * {{{https://github.com/username}}} all we need is the username bit.
* my $token = $ENV{GITHUB_TOKEN};
 * https://metacpan.org/module/FAYLAND/Net-GitHub-0.46/lib/Net/GitHub.pm#FAQ suggest you use {{{Padre-Plugin-Git}}} as the note for this token.
</pre>

<pre>
my $o     = $oauth->create_authorization(
	{   scopes => [ 'user', 'public_repo', 'repo', 'gist' ], # just ['public_repo']
		note => 'Padre-Plugin-Git',
	}
);
</pre>

<h2>Changes</h2>

* Auto write git commits to project Changes file

This use CPAN::Changes to write git commits to project Change file, 
This abuses the {{$NEXT}} token as a valid version, ( this is what it looks for {{$NEXT}} token in your Changes file )
<p>
see CPAN::Changes::Spec for format
<p>

suggest you make a copy first

<pre>
{{$NEXT}}
 - bump version to 0.01_06 [3a67ed7]
 - we don't die any more if client can't connect to a server, as we are a
   gui [7eaee9c]

0.01_06 2012-11-03
 - Update Changes to CPAN::Changes::Spec [abb591e]
 - Update Changes to CPAN::Changes::Spec [bde5532]
 - randomly select a status responses to correspond to wiki page [30bb6fa]
</pre>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

This provides Simple / Basic git cmd interface and a bit more.
<p>

//An example of this is the Stage / Commit -p(--patch) option which just fires up a terminal, for the interactivity//
<p>

if you want more, should look at the following, per say, or check the Git page.

<pre>
* git gui
* git cola
* gitg
</pre>

<h2>ToDo</h2>

<pre>
* basic local - DONE
* basic remote - DONE
* GitHub pull request - DONE

* await critiques :)
* release to CPAN - DONE
* mj41> bowtie: my daily git workflow is probably too complex ...  
 * git gui (to select lines to stage), 
 * git ci -a --fixup anySHA, 
 * git rebase -i, 
 * git reset --hard, 
 * git co somebranch
</pre>
