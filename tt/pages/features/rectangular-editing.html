<h2>Rectangular Text Selection</h2>

<p>
Simple text editors usually only allow you to select contiguous lines of text with your mouse.
Sometimes, however, it is handy to be able to select a rectangular area of text for more precise
cutting/copying/pasting or performing search/replace on. You can select a rectangular area in Padre
by holding down '''Shift+Alt''' whilst selecting text with your mouse or the arrow keys.

<p>
For example, imagine you have the following nicely formatted hash assignment in a Perl source file:
</p>
<pre>
  my %hash = (
      key1 => 'value1',
      key2 => 'value2',
      key3 => 'value3',
 );
</pre>
<p>
With a rectangular text selection you can select only the keys, only the values, etc..
