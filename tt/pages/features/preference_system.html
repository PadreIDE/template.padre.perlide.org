<h1 id="PreferenceSystem">Preference System</h1>
<p>
There are several types of preferences we can think of.
There are the current view printed preferences such as B&lt;Show newlines&gt;
or <strong>Show Line numbers</strong> and there are the project and file
oriented preferences such as the use of tabulators or white space
for indentation.
</p>
<p>
Currently some of the preferences are accessible via the
<strong>Edit =&gt; Preferences</strong> menu options, others via the <strong>View</strong>
menu option.
</p>
<p>
We have to make sure that when changing the preferences via
the GUI it change for the correct things.
</p>
<p>
E.g. when changing the <strong>Use Tabulators</strong> preference it currently
applies to all the files open currently or in the future.
It should probably apply to the current file and/or the
current project. Such options - when changing them - might even
be applied <i>retroactively</i>. That is when I change the tabulator/space
mode of a file or a project it should ask if I want to reflow the
file with the new method of indentation?
</p>
<p>
On the other hand the <i>Tabulator display size</i> is purely a local, editor
oriented preference. It should probably apply to all files currently
open.
</p>
<p>
There are other aspects of preferences as well that might not exactly
overlap with the above set:
</p>
<p>
The developer might work on the same project on different machines.
In such case some of the personal preferences should apply only
only on one computer while others apply in both places.
</p>
<p>
In particular if Padre is installed in a Portable Perl it might
run on machines with different parameters. Screen size and resolution
might be different along other parameters. We would like to make sure
the relevant preferences are separated from those that are constant
even when moving between computers.

* Size and location of windows
* Files recently opened
* Files that were open last time, cursor location
* Highlight indentation guide (TO DO)
</p>
<p>
This should be a separate option available only
if the <strong>Show indentation guide</strong> and brace matching is on.
</p>
<p>
If <strong>SetHighlightGuide</strong> is set to 8 then when the user reaches one
side of a pair of braces the indentation guide - if there is one
on column 8 - will be highlighted. (in green).
</p>
<p>
As I understand Padre should constantly adjust the <strong>SetHighlightGuide</strong>
so that in every block the &quot;correct&quot; indentation guide is highlighted.
</p>
<p>
* Tabulator display size
* Allow experimental features
</p>
<p>
In order to allow the experimental features one needs to manually turn on the
experimental flag to 1 in <strong>config.yml</strong>. As Padre keeps overwriting this file you'll
have to make this change with another editor and while Padre is B&lt;not&gt; open.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>config.yml</strong> file is in <strong>~/.padre/</strong> on Linux/Unix and in general in
your home directory on Windows. In any case the <strong>Help/About</strong> box will show
you the path of the <strong>.padre</strong> directory of Padre.
</p>
<p>
Once you set the experimental flag when you start Padre you will see a new
menu on the right side of the menu bar called <strong>Experimental</strong>.
</p>
<p>
* Open file policy
</p>
<p>
What files to open when launching Padre?
nothing, new, those that were open last time?
</p>
<p>
* Max/Min number of modules to display in POD viewer

* Indentation should be by tabulators or spaces
* In case of using spaces for indentation, the width  of every indentation level
