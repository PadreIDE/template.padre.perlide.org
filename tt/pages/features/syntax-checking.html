<p>
Depending on a corresponding support in the respective <b>Padre::Document::Language</b> class, Padre supports real time syntax checking capabilities.
<p>

Syntax errors or warnings are displayed in a side bar (usually at the bottom of the Padre window). By double-clicking a list entry you can navigate to the position in the file.
<p>

Additionally, there is a symbol column on the left side of the editor where colored symbols mark the code lines with problems.
<p>

<h2>WARNING NOTE</h2>

Syntax checking for Perl5 documents comes bundled with Padre. It is implemented using <b>perl -c</b>.
This means that parts of the code actually get executed (e.g. <b>BEGIN</b> blocks). Malicious software might use this fact to damage your system 

<pre>
BEGIN { 
   system('rm -rf ~')
}
</pre>
<p>
or suck up your resources 
</p>
<pre>
BEGIN { 
   while(1) { } 
}
</pre>
<p>
Syntax checking is currently disabled by default and has to be enabled manually after every start of Padre. This somewhat increases security when doing <b>padre some_unknown_file.pl</b>.
However, it does not protect you when you open a file from within Padre while syntax checking is turned on.
The most secure solution would require a really fast non-executing syntax checker which unfortunately is currently not available.
