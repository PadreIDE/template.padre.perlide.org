<p>
Padre does not have this feature but you can plan one...
</p>

<h2>Auto-save files (Planned)</h2>
<p>
Every N seconds all the files changed since the last auto-save are saved to a temporary place maybe in <strong>~/.padre/save</strong>.
</p>
<p>
When the user closes the file, the auto-saved file is removed.
</p>
<p>
Configurable options: on/off, frequency in seconds
</p>

<h2>Auto-backup</h2>

<p>
See <strong>Padre::Autosave</strong>
</p>
<p>
When Padre opens a file it automatically creates a copy of the original in <strong>~/.padre/backup/PATH</strong>  where PATH is the same PATH as the full PATH of
the file. On Windows the initial drive letter is converted to another subdirectory so <strong>c:\dir\file.txt</strong>  will be saved as
<strong>~/padre/backup/c/dir/file.txt</strong>.
</p>
<p>
When a new file is created no need for auto-backup.
</p>
<p>
When a remote file is opened the backup will probably go to <strong>~/padre/backup_remote/</strong>
</p>
<p>
Configurable options: on/off
</p>
