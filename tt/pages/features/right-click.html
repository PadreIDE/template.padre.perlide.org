<h2>Context Sensitive Menu</h2>

A context menu can be triggered from the editor main window using the common way of platform (one or multiple ways):
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Clicking on the right button of the mouse (All)</li>
  <li>Using the Menu key of the keyboard (at least Windows, Gnome)</li>
  <li>Using Shift+F10 on the keyboard (at least Windows, Gnome)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The pop-up presents a list of actions that can be executed.
The exact list depends on the file type and the specific location of the mouse cursor, or if triggered by the keyboard the position of the caret.

<p>
As Padre also tries to be keyboard friendly the same pop-up can be triggerd by pressing <b>Alt-/</b>

<h2>Menu Items</h2>

<b>Undo</b> and <b>Redo</b> are always listed but they might be grayed out. They are the same as in <b>Edit -> Undo and Redo</b>
<p>

<b>Open Selection</b> is show if there is a selection
<p>

<b>Open File in Browser</b> will open the File Explorer of Windows or Nautilus on Ubuntu at the directory where the current file can be found
<p>

<b>Find in Files</b>  will open that menu in <b>Search -> Find in Files...</b>
<p>

<b>Copy</b> and <b>Cut</b>, <b>Paste</b>, <b>Select All</b> the standard menu options
<p>

<b>Toggle Comment</b>, <b>Comment</b> and <b>Uncomment</b> can comment out one or more lines at a time
<p>

If the <b>Show Code Folding</b> is enabled and the mouse is over the folding margin on the left then
you can see another two menu options to <b>Fold All</b> and <b>Unfold All</b>.
<p>

In addition each document type can add its own menu items by implementing the <b>event_on_context_menu</b> method.
For example the Perl document class <a href="/trac/browser/trunk/Padre/lib/Padre/Document/Perl.pm">Padre::Document::Perl</a> adds
<b>Find Variable</b>, <b>Rename Variable</b> and the whole <b>Change Variable stye</b> submenu if the mouse is over a variable name.
<b>Find Method Declaration</b> if the mouse is over a subroutine or method name.
If something is selected then it will also show <b>Introduce Temporary Variable</b> and <b>Edit with Regex Editor</b>.
<p>

Finally the plugins can also add extra menu options. (See on_context_menu of the Plugin Manager)

<h2>Test</h2>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<a href="/trac/browser/trunk/Padre/lib/Padre/Wx/Menu/RightClick.pm">Padre::Wx::Menu::RightClick</a>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Describe in detail</li>
  <li>Allow plug-ins to add items</li>
  <li>Allow the user to configure what's in the context menu</li>
  <li>The Perl document should be able to recognize when the mouse is in a regex and show the <b>Edit with Regex Editor</b> only if it is and be able to paste the new regex back to the same location.</li>
</ul>
