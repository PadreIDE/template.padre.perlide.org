<h2>Run an application from within the editor</h2>

Simple running works but there are several options here.
<p>

Default: If the files is .pl save automatically and run it with the current perl.
<p>

Any other file, don't run for now, just display a message.
<p>

When running a script disable the Run menu and show a stop menu point.
Make sure both STDOUT and STDERR are displayed along with all of their newlines.
Allow for STDIN to be redirected to the external process.
<p>


<ul>
  <li>When developing a script we would like to run the current file (the one we currently watch) with some predefined options we should save these options before runs</li>
  <li>When developing a larger application with several modules and a script we would like to run a predefined script with some predefined options</li>
  <li>Both of the above should be either directly or using a debugger </li>
  <li>STDERR and STDOUT should be captured - for simple command line script we might want to have a full command line emulation?</li>
  <li>Run the unit tests assuming Makefile.PL or Build.PL</li>
</ul>
