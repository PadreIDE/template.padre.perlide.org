When the cursor reaches an opening or closing brace { }, square bracket [ ]
or parentheses ( ), Padre automatically highlight the pair of the braces.

<h3>Perl -&gt; Find Unmatched Brace (brace)</h3>

Initial observations, 
<ul>
  <li>works in current editor, does not require the file to be saved :)</li>
  <li>highlights the last unmatched ;-(</li>
  <li>I think it must be counting charter types, with little reference to Perl syntax ;-(</li>
</ul>

<p>
This file passes, this is rubbish ;-((

<p>
run against Padre <tt><a  href="/trac/changeset/14200">r14200</a></tt>
</p>
<p>
Opps should have run the Syntax Checker first, or should I
</p>

<hr>
<ul>
  <li>the editor appears to highlight matching braces in luminous green :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Edit-&gt; Brace Matching (//brace//) Ctrl+1</h3>

<ul>
  <li>moves the cursor for you</li>
  <li>If the cursor is outside a //brace//, it matches to the outside of it's pair. either forward or backwards :)</li>
  <li>If the cursor is inside a //brace//, it matches to the inside of it's pair. either forward or backwards :)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Q, why is this on the menu and not just a keyboard shortcut!
</p>

<h3>Edit -&gt; Select To Brace Matching (//brace//) Ctrl+4</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Cool :)</li>
  <li>Inside outside matching //braces// as above, and highlights selection for you :)</li>
  <li>you still need to explicitly copy to place selection on clipboard</li>
  <li>X11 copy don't work</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>NB</b> the above actions also work with &quot;line 7 added [" &amp; "line 13 added ]&quot; hence we are treating //brace// behind a # comment as active ;-((
</p>

<h3>Perl -&gt; Find Unmatched Brace (//brace//)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Checkes for a lone single //brace//</li>
  <li>appears to work, but in following code in stead of highlighting **}**#odd brace not found, highlights my **[**( $sec on the preceding line.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Behaviour</h3>
<p>
the image below shows a composite of the pertinent information.
<img src="/images/prefs_braces.png">
</p>

<h4>Auto-complete Brackets</h4>
<p>
When checked, if you type an opening //brace// or String Literal, you get the closing inserted immediately after for you.
</p>

<h4>Add another closing bracket</h4>
<p>
appears to be superfluous
</p>

<h2>TO DO</h2>
<p>
make this optional, let the user set the colour
