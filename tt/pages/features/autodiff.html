== Margin Markers
</p>
<p>
Revision 16300 marks a new milestone in Padre version control system (VCS) support. You can now type and Padre will automatically calculate differences and display them as margin markers.
* plus (added), dark green.
* minus (deleted), red.
* right arrow marker (changed), blue.
You can click then on those margin markers to show what has actually been added, deleted or changed.

== Diff-Box
</p>
<p>
Just wanted to say that I recently added a differences popup window to Padre's editor.
* You can now traverse all differences in your current document (via **Ctrl + comma**).
* The dialog shows you what was added, deleted or changed at the current difference and enables you to revert the change if needed.
* Padre can also automatically detect and find differences against your local repository (subversion or git) or the locally saved document.

Note two Tabs -&gt; 8 Chr per Tab = 16 charters indent Ouch!

* suggest 1 Tab = 2 charters, will maximise the diff-box real-estate.

== VCS
To Diff against VCS you need to enable **feature_vcs_support = TRUE** in Tool-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Advanced
</p>
<p>
Currently supported vcs.
* SUBVERSION =&gt; 'SVN',
* GIT        =&gt; 'Git',

== Miscellaneous
Q, I do not see any content in the Diff-Box for add, only changed and deleted.
</p>
<p>
A, aha...\\
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
   that's the trick\\
   you get old text in your diff box\\
   so you can revert it\\
   if you add new lines, then nothing\\
   get it?\\
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
\\
Q, So the diff stuff is relying on the underlying VCS tools and not an internal Padre thing.
</p>
<p>
A, svn =&gt; does a trick by reading .svn\file to diff in memory\\
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
   git =&gt; git show HEAD:$filename and then diff in memory\\
   diff in memory using Algorithm::Diff\\
   so they are not network bound\\
   and it is a background task...
   svn or git failed... fallback to editor buffer against saved document diff\\
   and the cool thing is that you can revert what's changed...\\
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
\\
Q, Until you save it?
</p>
<p>
A, local =&gt; until you save\\
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
   svn project =&gt; svn diff\\
   git project =&gt; git diff\\
</p>
