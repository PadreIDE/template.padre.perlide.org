<h2>Margin Markers</h2>
<p>
Revision 16300 marks a new milestone in Padre version control system (VCS) support. You can now type and Padre will automatically calculate differences and display them as margin markers.
<ul>
  <li>plus (added), dark green.</li>
  <li>minus (deleted), red.</li>
  <li>right arrow marker (changed), blue.</li>
</ul>
You can click then on those margin markers to show what has actually been added, deleted or changed.

<h2>Diff-Box</h2>

<p>
Just wanted to say that I recently added a differences popup window to Padre's editor.
<ul>
  <li>You can now traverse all differences in your current document (via **Ctrl + comma**).</li>
  <li>The dialog shows you what was added, deleted or changed at the current difference and enables you to revert the change if needed.</li>
  <li>Padre can also automatically detect and find differences against your local repository (subversion or git) or the locally saved document.</li>
</ul>
</p>

</p>
<p>
Note two Tabs -&gt; 8 Chr per Tab = 16 charters indent Ouch!
</p>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>suggest 1 Tab = 2 charters, will maximise the diff-box real-estate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Previous Diff</h3>
<p>
<img src="/images/autodiff/go-up.png" /> Move to Previous Diff.
</p>

<h3>Next Diff</h3>
<p>
<img src="/images/autodiff/go-down.png" /> Move to Next Diff.
</p>

<h3>Revert</h3>
<p>
<img src="/images/autodiff/edit-undo.png" /> Revert current Diff.
</p>

<h2>VCS</h2>
<p>
To Diff against VCS you need to enable **feature_vcs_support = TRUE** in Tool-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Advanced
</p>
<p>
Currently supported vcs.
<ul>
  <li>SUBVERSION =&gt; 'SVN',</li>
  <li>GIT        =&gt; 'Git',</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>
Q, I do not see any content in the Diff-Box for add, only changed and deleted.
</p>
<p>
A, aha...
</p>

<pre>
   that's the trick
   you get old text in your diff box
   so you can revert it
   if you add new lines, then nothing
   get it?
</pre>
<p>
Q, So the diff stuff is relying on the underlying VCS tools and not an internal Padre thing.
</p>
<p>
A, svn =&gt; does a trick by reading .svn\file to diff in memory
</p>
<pre>
   git =&gt; git show HEAD:$filename and then diff in memory
   diff in memory using Algorithm::Diff
   so they are not network bound
   and it is a background task...
   svn or git failed... fallback to editor buffer against saved document diff
   and the cool thing is that you can revert what's changed...
</pre>

<p>
Q, Until you save it?
</p>
<p>
A, local =&gt; until you save
</p>
<pre>
   svn project =&gt; svn diff
   git project =&gt; git diff
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>MERCURIAL  =&gt; 'Mercurial',</li>
  <li>BAZAAR     =&gt; 'Bazaar',</li>
  <li>CVS        =&gt; 'CVS',</li>
</ul>
