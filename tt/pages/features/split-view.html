<h2>Description</h2>

Allow the user to see 2 or more files at the same by splitting up the existing window horizontally or vertically

<h2>TODO</h2>

ps. A related feature that we keep confusing is to be able to open the same file in two windows (or tabs) and 
to be in different locations in both tabs. This is especially useful in Split View mode when I can see the upper part of the
file in the upper window and the lower part of the file in lower window even if the file is very big.
