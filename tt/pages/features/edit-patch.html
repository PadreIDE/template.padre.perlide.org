<h2>Edit -> Patch</h2>
<p>
Patch only works on files in local editor that are saved, ie it ignores files with leading * prefix in there name.
</p>
<p>
It is simplistic in it's approach, as it only works on one file at a time, If you need to work with files/projects look at one of our Plug-ins.
</p>
<p>
Patch tries to auto select the correct file in each list where relevant.
</p>

<p>
the techie one liner <b>Action, Against, Select File-1, Select File-2 if appropriate and then Process</b>
</p>

<h2>Right Click</h2>
<p>
If your current file in Padre is a patch file ( *.patch or *.diff ) and you Right click you get the following.

<h2>Using Patch</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To Launch the Patch Dialogue, Menu Bar, Edit->Patch...</li>
  <li>By default Patch will assume it is working in Patch mode and if started with a {{{*.patch}}} file as current file. Patch will try to find among the other open files a corresponding file to apply the {{{*.patch}}} against as shown below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Logic</h3>

<pre>
                Against  comments
Patch   File-1  File-2   auto select File-1 based on File-2 name, File-2 auto select based on extension
Action  Diff    File-1   File-2=||auto select File-1 based on current file, File-2 auto select file 0
        Diff    File-1   SVN=||auto select File-1 based on current file,File-2 n/a
</pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Normal information will go to Padre status bar.
    <br>
    We have assumed Show low-priority info messages on Status-bar (not in a pop-up) is true, 
  </li>
  <li>Patch results in a new Tab in Padre editor titled unsaved</li>
  <li>Diff results in file-name suffixed with .patch, saved in same location as file-name and opened in Padre editor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Error / Info</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Any error message will be displayed in Padre Output panel.</li>
  <li>SVN version violation information is displayed in the status bar.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Patch uses Text::Patch.</li>
  <li>Diff uses Text::Diff.M<br>SVN local client is used if present, if not SVN radio button will be greyed out.</li>
  <li>Patch... will be greyed out if there are no open files in editor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>File List display in order files were loaded into Padre, if you have move files around by dragging there Tab this will not be reflected in List display order.</li>
  <li>If you have multiple files open with same name but with different paths only the first will get matched.</li>
  <li>SVN local Client is also tested for version greater than or equal to 1.6.2.
     <br>From Subversion changes:- fixed: segfault on merge with servers &lt; 1.6 (r37363, -67, -68, -79)
  </li>
  <li>Patch some times throws errors relating to POD lines starting with ( C&lt;, =, ) giving the following output.<br>
       Hunk #n failed at line xxx.</li>
</ul>
