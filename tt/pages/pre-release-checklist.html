<h2>Reports by version and tester</h2>

 * 0.82: <a href="/trac/wiki/PreReleaseChecklist/0.82/zenog">PreReleaseChecklist/0.82/zenog</a>

Sample reporting for  each feature:

<pre>
 || Who || SVN revision || Padre version || system || status ||
 || szabgab || r13895 || v0.84 || Ubuntu 10.10 || fail #1107 ||
 || szabgab || r15835 || v0.86 || Ubuntu 10.10 || success ||

</pre>

In case of failure please include the following information in the bug report:

 * OS: 
 * Perl: 
 * Wx: 
 * wxWidgets: 
 * Wx::Perl::ProcessStream: 
 * PPI: 



== Prepare for the testing ==

 * check whether you are running the to-be-released Padre version by opening the "About" box

If you'd like to test the current development version of Padre then please check it out
as 
{{{
svn co http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/Padre
}}}
and then run it from there.

If you'd like to test the release branch then please check out the release branch:
{{{
svn co http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/Padre-0.84/
}}}

Do the regular things: 
{{{
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
}}}

and then launch padre using
{{{
perl -Ilib script/padre
}}}

Other possibility is to actually install the release candidate using
{{{
make install
}}}

and then launch by just typing
{{{
padre
}}}

== What to report ==
 * for each single item
  * OK or
   * crashes
   * inconsistent behaviour
   * actions that do not work as expected
 * for each section
  * How much time did it take you to perform the tests?

= Test Cases =


== Perl 5 scripts ==

see #496

 1. open a Perl script (using Ctrl-o or File/Open)
 1. run it by hitting F5
 1. change to the other output variant (external window or internal pane) (Tools/Preferences/Run Parameters/Use external window for execution)
 1. run it by hitting Shift-F5
 1. enable syntax checks (View/Show Syntax Check)
 1. introduce a syntax error and inspect resulting output
 1. click on the syntax error to jump to the position of the error
 1. enable autocomplete at "Tools"->"Preferences"->"Autocomplete"
 1. start typing a word which is already in the file (maybe "warn" from "warnings")
 1. hit Ctrl-Space, select a suggestion and confirm it
 1. enable bracket autocomplete at "Tools"->"Preferences"->"Behavior"
 1. type ( [ { " ' - each of them should get its closing part automatically

 || Who || SVN revision || Padre version || system || status ||
 || szabgab || r14034 || v0.84 || Ubuntu 10.10 || fail (crash) #1167 (also: Shift-F5 does not do anything) ||

== Perl 5 modules ==
 1. open a large Perl module from the Padre source
 1. enable "View"->"Show Functions"
 1. double-click on a function name to jump to its location in the file
    * the text cursor should be at the corresponding function in the file
 1. enable "View"->"Show Outline"
 1. double-click on a method name to jump to its location in the file
    * the text cursor should be at the corresponding location in the file

== Text files ==
 1. "File" -> "New"
 1. save it as {{{file.txt}}}
 1. save it as {{{file}}}
 1. load a text file from disk
 1. use "Edit" -> "Go To ..." to jump to a given line
 1. use "Edit" -> "Go To ..." to jump to a given character position

== Saving perl file without extension needs to remember its mime-type ==

See #1107, #849

 1. "File" -> "New"
 1. type in 
{{{
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
}}}
 1. save it as {{{file}}}
 1. Check if the mime-type (3rd box on the status bar) says "Perl 5"
 1. Close the file
 1. Open The file using "File" -> "Open"
 1. Check if the mime-type (3rd box on the status bar) says "Perl 5"
 1. Open The file using "File" -> "Save As"
 1. save it as {{{file2}}}
 1. Check if the mime-type (3rd box on the status bar) says "Perl 5"

 1. Repeat the above but this time the content of the file should be
{{{
#!/usr/bin/env perl

print 42;
}}}

 1. A third time in which case the content should be
{{{
#!/usr/local/bin/perl

print "ok";
}}}

== Package 'main' lost in outline if followed by another package ==
See #1206
 1. "File" -> "New"
 1. add three lines of code
{{{
sub foo{}
package umpf;
sub bar{}
}}}
 1. Check the 'Outline': foo() and bar() are shown in package 'umpf', but foo() is in package 'main'

== Some other stuff to be tested ==

 1. Open Padre with several files
 1. cycle through the files using the keyboard: Ctrl-PageUp and Ctrl-PageDown
 1. close one tab
 1. go to "File" -> "Recent Files" and re-open the file ( #1143, #1148 )

== Word Wrap ==
 ''View -> Word-Wrap''.
 by enabling word wrap, padre wont let you expand the code block horizontally, if you'll try it will go to the next line.

== Fresh Padre Installation ==

TODO: we should add some tests to check if a fresh Padre installation (or an upgrade) works
