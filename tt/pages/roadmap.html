In general everyone works on his/her favorite area.

<p>

We encourage developers to open tickets for the ideas but often people just implement features.

<p>

We release about once a week when we feel the project is stable enough.

<p>

Based on the mail thread [http://mail.perlide.org/pipermail/padre-dev/2009-August/001184.html]

<ul>
  <li>Integrating features from Ecliptic to core (azawawi++)</li>
  <li>Move F2 from Perl 6 to core, provide context sensitive help for Perl 5 keywords, variables and constructs (azawawi++)</li>
  <li>CPAN GUI client - beginning are in the 'Perl 5 plugin' (see yumex ?)</li>
  <li>SVN/Git integration improvement (maybe also CVS and RCS ?)
     <ul>
        <li>Run on Windows</li>
        <li>Integrate into directory browser</li>
        <li>Other improvements</li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Separate out the Wx::Perl::Dialog and Wx::Perl::Dialog::Simple package (after making Alias happy) or maybe only Wx::Perl::Dialog::Simple ? so I can start using it in simple examples for scripts.</li>
  <li>Debugger integration (with the visual elements)</li>
  <li>Packaging for Linux and Mac OSX (to make it easy to just download, unzip and run it)</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>Emacs keybinding (Teejay)</li>
  <li>Versioned saves, See Padre::Autosave</li>
  <li>"Install from CPAN" when right-clicking on a red line marking the attempt to "use" an unknown module - Andreas Lund</li>
</ul>

<h2>Plans</h2>

An outline of where Padre is heading

<ul>
  <li>Make Padre a good replacement for <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> by making it stable and having all the feature that are really useful in Notepad++</li>
  <li>Make Padre a good replacement of <a href="http://www.multiedit.com/">Multi-Edit</a> and <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">Ultra-Edit</a></li>
  <li>Cover the planned <a href="/features/">Features</a></li>
  <li>Provide integration with version control systems - at least SVN, SVK and Git.</li>
  <li>Provide integration with Bug tracking system - at least Bugzilla and Trac.</li>
  <li>Cooperative editing (at minimum we would like to let one person edit and the others watch)</li>
  <li>Provide a platform for application development (along with Strawberry Perl)</li>
</ul>
