<h2>Development in general</h2>

<p>
We are using GitHub for version control.
The main development of Padre is in <a href="https://github.com/PadreIDE/Padre">Padre</a> repositort,  but there are several 
additional projects and almost all the plugins of Padre also live in the same <a href="https://github.com/PadreIDE/">GitHub orgaization</a>.
</p>

Fork the repository using the "Fork" button on GitHub then clone the forked repository using <b>git clone ...</b>.

Then you can run the standard CPAN module process:

Make sure you have all of the needed prerequisites. See <a href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/wiki/Download">Download</a>

<pre>
$ cd padre/Padre
$ perl Makefile.PL      # which will tell about all the missing dependencies of Padre
                        # this may fail if you don't have Module::Install
                        # if so, start cpan and install it with all its prerequisites
$ make
$ make test
</pre>

For a more detailed set of instructions on how to install the dependencies visit the [wiki:Download]

Once all the above works well you can launch Padre from the SVN tree by running

<pre>
$ perl dev
</pre>

dev has some more parameters you can see by typing

<pre>
$ perl dev -h
</pre>

The most important being

<pre>
$ perl dev -a
</pre>

that will include the path to all the plugins located in trunk/

<h2>Coding</h2>

See the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Padre/lib/Padre/Manual/Hacking.pod">Hacking.pod</a> file for Core Padre development
and the one for <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Padre/lib/Padre/Plugin.pm">Plugin development</a>.

<h2>Translation</h2>

Translation is basically part of the development effort. For more details please take a look at this page:
See <a href="/trac/wiki/TranslationIntro">TranslationIntro</a>.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

The documentation of Padre is standard POD embedded in the .pm files. If you'd like to 
improve those you should check out the source code of Padre as described above and send
patches or ask for commit bit. The documentation is part of the regular development process.


<h2>QA/Testing</h2>

Unfortunately Padre has not enough automated test mostly due to the fact that 
we hardly know how to test GUI applications. The existing tests are located 
in the standard t/ directory. 
If you'd like to help in this and if you are on Windows you could take a look at the 
t/win32/ directory where we have a few tests written using Win32::GUItest.
You would be very highly regarded if you improved the test coverage of Padre!!

<h2>Release Management</h2>

See separate page about <a href="/trac/wiki/Release">Release</a>


<h2>Development in a branch</h2>

Most of our development is done on the trunk but occasionally we prefer to make our private corner for experimental changes
or changes that might not be stable for some time.
Instructions on how to do that:

Create a branch and work on it:

Assuming you have already checked out http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/ to /path/to/padre

<pre>
$ svn cp http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/Padre http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/My-branch -m'some messages'
$ cd /path/to/padre/Padre
$ svn switch http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/My-branch .
</pre>

If you run 
<pre>
svn st ..
</pre>

You will see a letter S infront to the Padre directory as that one is switched.

Now you can edit, test and commit as usual. Your changes will be committed to the branch.


When done and you would like to merge your changes

1. Make sure everything is committed

<pre>
$ cd /path/to/padre/Padre
$ svn switch http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/Padre
$ svn log --stop-on-copy http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/My-branch
</pre>

This will show you the changes you made on the branch. Take the FIRST and LAST revision numbers in this log and
use the following command to see the full change you made:

<pre>
svn diff -rFIRST:LAST http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/My-branch
</pre>

use the following to merge it back to trunk

<pre>
svn merge -rFIRST:LAST http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/My-branch .
svn commit -m'merged  -rFIRST:LAST http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/My-branch '
svn rm http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/My-branch -m'My-branch is not needed any more'
</pre>

If you decided it was a dead-end you can just switch back to trunk and remove the branch.
