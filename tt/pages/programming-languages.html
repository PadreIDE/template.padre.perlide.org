On this page we try to design how Padre should handle various needs of programming languages
and file types.

Every type can have several tools for syntax highlighting, for execution, help, etc

<h2>Types</h2>

<h3>Syntax highlighting can be by</h3>
 * Scintilla (STC)
 * Kate plugin (which is just a few regular expressions in Perl 5)
 * Parrot parse tree
 * Other

<h3>Execution</h3>
 * Various implementations


<h2>Perl 5</h2>

<h3>Syntax highlighting</h3>

 * STC - old but fast
 * PPI - slow but quite good, can provide parse tree
 * Kate - (some Perl 5 regexes)
 * Parrot - Not available

<h3>Execution</h3>

 * There can be several different versions of the perl compiler installed

<h2>Perl 6</h2>

<h3>Syntax highlighting</h3>

 * by STD.pm (in Padre::Plugin:Perl6) 
 * simple vi-style regex (will be in Padre::Plugin::Perl6 or separately to reduce the need for prereqs?) (Kate integration)
 * by Parrot (subclass if Padre::Plugin::Parrot?)
 * * Embedded Parrot
 * * externally executed Parrot
 * * Installed / development version of Parrot

<h3>Execution</h3>

Can have various implementations:
 * Parrot/Rakudo
 * Pugs ?
 * ??

Can be installed/development etc.

<h3>Embedding</h3>

 * by Parrot + Rakudo + Parrot::Interpreter (Parrot built, languages/perl6 built, Parrot::Embed built)

<h2>PIR/PASM</h2>

<h3>Syntax highlighting</h3>

 * by simple regex
 * by Parrot

<h3>Execution</h3>

 * by Parrot

<h3>Embedding</h3>

 * by Parrot + Parrot::Interpreter

<h2>Python</h2>

It has several implementations

 * Pynie


<h2>PHP</h2>

 * Several versions of the official PHP
 * Pipp
