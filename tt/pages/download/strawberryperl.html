You should be able to install Padre by just tying
</p>
<blockquote>
  c:\> cpan Padre
</blockquote>
<p>
on the command window (cmd).
</p>
<p>
However, before you do that, you may wish to install Alien::wxWidgets and Wx as those can sometime cause a bit of a headache.
</p>
<pre>
  C:\> cpan Alien::wxWidgets
  C:\> cpan Wx
</pre>
<p>
Please note, each of these command can take quite some time depending on your system.
</p>
<p>
If the above does not work you can try an even more manual approach:
</p>
<pre>
  c:\> cpan
  cpan> look Alien::wxWidgets
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ dmake
  $ dmake test
  $ dmake install
  $ exit
  cpan> look Wx
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ dmake
  $ dmake test
  $ dmake install
  $ exit
  cpan> install Padre
</pre>

<p>
Once it is installed you can start Padre either by Start/Run and type in
<pre>
padre
</pre>
</p>
<p>
or by creating a shortcut and then clicking on it.
</p>
<p>
When creating the shortcut use the following as command:
<pre>
C:\strawberry\perl\bin\wperl.exe C:\strawberry\perl\bin\padre.bat
</pre>
note we are using wperl here instead of perl in order to avoid the extra 
command shell window.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: installing Padre in a fresh install of Strawberry Perl can lead to weird behaviour,
like preferences not being saved on exit (due to Padre crashing on exit). See the comments for <a  href="http://padre.perlide.org/trac/ticket/258">#258</a> for a workaround.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: For updating Padre on Strawberry Perl you can use the CPAN shell client of Strawberry: 
</p>
<pre>
  c:\> cpan
  cpan> upgrade Padre
</pre>
<p>
To find whether there's an update - you can do: 
<pre>
 cpan> i /Padre/
</pre>
(or simply follow the mailing list ;-)
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>
If one of the dependencies fails to install, there are a number things you can do. 
<ul>
  <li>Got to <a href="http://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a>, look for the module that failed to install and check if the problem has been reported. If, please report it.</li>
  <li>If the problem is only in the tests you could install the module while skipping the tests using <b>notest install Module::Name</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Still Not Working?</h2>
