Once Padre or one of the plugins is released based on the following process it is uploaded to CPAN.
There are various way [wiki:Distribution Repackaging and Distributing] those modules.

<h2>Prerequisites to releasing Padre</h2>

As the Release Manager you will be uploading the Padre tarball to pause, to ensure you have the 
right permissions to do this you must obtain co-maintenance permissions for all of the namespaces in the Padre distribution. Talk to Gábor Szabó (szabgab), Adam Kennedy (Alias), or Steffen Müller (tsee) about this. Make sure you get Wx::Perl::Dialog, Wx::Perl::Dialog::Frame, Wx::Perl::Dialog::Simple, and Wx::Perl::Dialog::SingleChoice too.

For the ppi_version utility, install PPI::PowerToys.

<h2>Release of Padre using a branch</h2>

In order to allow a few days of stabilization of Padre and to allow the translators to catch up while 
allowing everyone else to freely work on the main trunk we release from a branch. 

<p>

A few (2 or 3) days before the planned release date the release manager creates an svn copy of trunk to branches/release-n.nn.

<h2>The high level steps are as follows:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure all tests pass,</li>
  <li>Set the release version, commit,</li>
  <li>Tidy the project, commit,</li>
  <li>Update Changes file, commit,</li>
  <li>Rebuild the messages.pot, commit, ** no longer required **</li>
  <li>Set the version from current dev to next production release, commit,</li>
  <li>Branch</li>
  <li>Announce branch and URL to dev list,</li>
  <li>Allow a few days for translators,</li>
  <li>Build Tar Ball,</li>
  <li>Test where you can.</li>
  <li>Upload to PAUSE.</li>
  <li>Prior to merge back, set version to current dev version ( should be  +1 ), commit,</li>
  <li>Merge changes on Branch back to Trunk, this should only be the translations if all went well.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Steps for a Release</h2>

Note: All commands are taken as relative to your Padre directory ( the one with Makefile.PL in it )

<ol>
  <li>run perltidy on the trunk  {{{ ../tools/tidy_project.pl }}}</li>
  <li>commit </li>
  <li>Update the Changes file, noting the date of the release being the date you start the branch</li>
  <li>commit</li>
  <li>set the version from the current development version number to the release version number ( should be even numbered for released odd numbers for development )</li>
  <li>Note: there is a script in tools that will update the $VERSION string, however PPI::PowerToys has an awesome ppi_version, use this when you can: {{{ppi_version change old_ver new_ver}}}, ie {{{ppi_version change 0.81 0.82}}}</li>
  <li>commit</li>
  <li>rebuild the "messages.pot" file, run {{{ ../tools/update_pot_file.pl }}}</li>
  <li>commit</li>
</ol>

At this point trunk is ready for you to make the branch:
 * {{{ svn cp http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/Padre http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/Padre-X.XX   }}} (replace X.XX with the future version number)

You have now created the for Padre.

To complete the final tasks on trunk, update the Changes file by "opening" the next version.

 * Modify Changes, set the next development version number, this should be odd and the next release version number should be even, ie if you have just branched release-0.82, then changes gets updated with:

0.84 TBA

0.83 Dev - not released.

Make the changes to the version number to the next development cycle number:
{{{ppi_version change 0.82 0.83}}}

* Commit the changes

From this point onwards you switch your working copy between the branch and trunk as needed.  To switch between trunk and the branch:

<ul>
  <li>{{{ svn switch http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/Padre-X.XX }}} .</li>
  <li>then every commit will go to the branch while the plugins are still from trunk</li>
  <li>the release can be done here but probably it is better NOT to run the perl tidy on the branch as it will make merging very difficult</li>
</ul>


<h2>Announce the Branch in padre-dev</h2>

Announce the branch in the dev mailing list and put out a call for translators, an email template is provided:

<pre>

Hi Team,

I have just made a branch of trunk for the next Padre release <version>.

Could all translators be so kind as to update their language.

To do so, either check out a working copy of the branch here:

{{{svn co http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/Padre-<version>}}}

or alternately you can switch your working copy:

{{{svn switch http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/Padre-<version>}}}

Please commit all changes to the branch for inclusion into the next great release of Padre.

Regards,

NAME
Padre Release Manager.
</pre>

<h2>Do the regular release process</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The release manager first builds a distribution and when she is sure it creates a good release, she can run the release.pl script again to also tag the release in SVN and then ask others to test it:
      <ul>
         <li>the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING should be set to ensure testing for a release is run.</li>
         <li>the release.pl script will set it if the variable isn't found.  If you want more control over the testing before a release set RELEASE_TESTING to 1 to test, 0 to turn testing off.</li>
         <li>run {{{ perl ../tools/release.pl --revision REV --version VERSION }}} will try to create a distribution using a temporary directory and copy the resulting Padre-X.XX.tar.gz in the current directory. </li>
         <li>Test it by yourself (install it using pip, run it)</li>
         <li>run {{{ perl ../tools/release.pl --revision REV --version VERSION --tag }}} This will also create a tag in SVN. </li>
         <li>Upload it somewhere public and ask Gabor to copy to http://perlide.org/download/source/</li>
         <li>Tell people on IRC #padre about it and ask them to test it</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  <li>Upload to PAUSE</li>
  <li>Send announcement to [http://mail.perlide.org/mailman/listinfo/padre-dev padre-dev] mailing list</li>
  <li>Send announcement to [http://mail.perlide.org/mailman/listinfo/padre-news padre-news] mailing list (Gabor might need to send the message but at leas he needs to approve it after you sent it)</li>
  <li>Submit announcement to http://use.perl.org/ or some other well-read blog (e.g. one that is syndicated on Iron Man and on http://blogs.padre.perlide.org/ )</li>
  <li>Update the [wiki:Release_History Release History]</li>
  <li>Add the version number to the list of versions in Trac. A trac admin needs to do this:
     <ul>
        <li>Go to Admin/Versions in the "Name:" box type in the version number eg. 0.45, click on "Add"</li>
        <li>Select the radio box on the right hand side of the newly added line and click on "Apply changes"</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
  <li>Important: Assign primary maintainer status to Gabor (PAUSE ID 'SZABGAB') for all namespaces that are new in the current release.
     <ul>
        <li>Log into your PAUSE account</li>
        <li>Click "View Permissions" in the menu</li>
        <li>Note all Padre::* classes for which you are listed as "first-come" (as opposed to "co-maint").</li>
        <li>Click "Change Permissions" in the menu</li>
        <li>Under "2. You are primary maintainer:" select any one or all of the Padre::* namespaces that appear in the list view.</li>
        <li>Click Select for "2.1 Pass primary maintainership status to somebody else (giving it up at the same time)"</li>
        <li>Make sure all Padre::* namespaces are selected in the new listbox.</li>
        <li>Enter "SZABGAB" in the text field.</li>
        <li>Click "Pass Maintainership Status".</li>
        <li>You will automatically become co-maintainer instead of primary maintainer of the classes in question.</li>
     </ul>
   </li>
  <li>Update [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padre_%28software%29 Padre's Wikipedia] page with the new version number</li>
  <li>ppm creation:
     <ul>
         <li>tar xzf Padre-X.XX.tar.gz</li>
         <li>perl Makefile.PL</li>
         <li>make</li>
         <li>make ppm  will create a Padre.ppd file and a Padre.tar.gz file</li>
         <li>change the other files in /trunk/ppm according to the README there</li>
         <li>upload Padre.tar.gz as Padre-X.XX.tar.gz to http://perlide.org/download/ppm/</li>
         <li>upload the other files from trunk/ppm to http://perlide.org/download/ppm/</li>
     </ul>
   </li>
  <li>Create executable for Linux:
    <ul>
      <li>make exe</li>
      <li>Upload to http://perlide.org/download/binary/</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Merging back to trunk</h2>

<ol>
  <li>set the version in the branch to the current development version, {{{ppi_version change old_ver new_ver}}}</li>
  <li>when finished merge the branch back to trunk:</li>
  <li>{{{ svn switch http://svn.perlide.org/padre/trunk/Padre }}} .</li>
  <li>{{{ svn log --stop-on-copy  http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/Padre-X.XX }}}</li>
  <li>Take the FIRST and LAST revision number from that log</li>
  <li>{{{ svn merge -rFIRST:LAST http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/Padre-X.XX/ }}} .</li>
  <li>If you do not get any merge conflicts, then follow the next step, otherwise use "Resolving Merge Conflicts" as a quick guide to help resolve any conflicts.</li>
  <li>{{{ svn commit -m'merge -rFIRST:LAST http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/Padre-X.XX/' }}}</li>
  <li>now you can remove the release branch:</li>
  <li>{{{ svn rm http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/Padre-X.XX/ }}}</li>
</ol>


<h2>Resolving Merge Conflicts</h2>

If you are fortunate you will not see merge conflicts when you merge the branch back to trunk, however
if you do, then the following is a quick crib on how to deal with it.
<p>

When dealing with merge conflicts consider "where you are".  If you switched from the branch to trunk, the notion of "theirs-full" is going to be the branch that you are merging in.  If you are merging trunk back to the branch, then trunk will be "theirs" and the branch will be "mine".
<p>

When you make a mistake with the merge, you can undo the merge with {{{ svn merge -c -15702 . }}} where the revision number here is the revision number of the commit to trunk you just made after merging.
<p>

Once you have done that, commit the change to trunk, start the merge from the branch again, keeping in mind "where you are".
<p>

Note: you will likely get a conflict with messages.pot, you can "skip" this conflict by selecting "tf", "Theirs Full"
option if you are merging trunk to the branch, or "mf", "Mine Full" if the merge is the branch to trunk.
<p>

When svn updating you SVN will halt at the file in conflict asking you what to do, simply select "postpone" as 
we will go back to the conflicted file(s) after the merge has completed.
<p>

SVN will create three files if there is a merge conflict in trunk and the branch, a 'left.merge', 'working' and 'right.merge' file.
<p>

The simple way to work this out, is open the actual file in vim.
<p>

Look for lines that begin with &gt;&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;&lt; 
<p>

Depending on which lines you keep, remove the lines between &gt;&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;&lt; and === and remove these lines too.
<p>

Once you have completed the merge and are happy with the changes, tell svn you have resolved the problem:
<p>

svn resolved file-name
<p>

This removes the merge conflict files.
<p>

Once you have completed all the conflicts, return back to the parent directory and svn commit with a message like 'merge -rFIRST:LAST http://svn.perlide.org/padre/branches/Padre-X.XX/'
as this shows up in the log where you merged the branch back.
<p>

<h2>Release of Plugins and other packages</h2>

The packages can use either Makefile.PL (Module::Install) or Build.PL  (Module::Build).
We have not tested the below process with ExtUtils::Makemaker
<p>


No need to keep MANIFEST and META.yml in version control!
<p>

Add to MANIFEST.SKIP

<pre>
# avoid pot files (gettext)
\.pot$
</pre>

<p>


If you are using Module::Build
<p>

Don't add a Makefile.PL to the version control as it will be created during packaging


<h2>Release process</h2>

<ol>
  <li>cd to the directory of the plugin or the package</li>
  <li>../tools/</li>
  <li>run {{{ perl ../tools/tidy_project.pl }}} (commit)</li>
  <li>run {{{ perl ../tools/update_version_number.pl VERSION }}} and update Changes (commit)</li>
  <li>run {{{ perl ../tools/release.pl REV VERSION [--tag] }}} </li>
  <li>upload to PAUSE</li>
</ol>


<h2>Release Manager</h2>

The current release manager is Peter Lavender (waxhead on [wiki:IRC IRC]).

<h2>Release schedule</h2>

The exact release schedule is decided by the current release manager, below are the general guidelines
<p>

Padre is released to CPAN about once every week when trunk seems to be in a stable state.
<p>

Once a month we set aside a version for a "packaged" release for which we use a longer time on the release branch.
<p>

We take the latest regular release and base the "packaged" release right on the regular release.
So for example we have 0.43, 0.44, regular releases then based on 0.44 we create a release branch for 0.45
We give the translators a few days to catch up on this branch. That time will also allow
people to give feedback on 0.44 so we can fix really critical issues on the 0.45 branch.
<p>

This release should be scheduled just a few days after Rakudo is released.
<p>

Once it is done CSJewell  creates the windows [wiki:Distribution distributions] based on Strawberry Perl.
<p>

That means we have these "packaged" and translated releases by ~ 20-25th of every month.
<p>

See this post http://mail.perlide.org/pipermail/padre-dev/2009-August/001203.html
and create a better tuned process for the "packaged" releases.
